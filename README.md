# Responsibility Attribution for Collective Decision Makers

Abstract

We argue that individuals use responsibility attribution heuristics that apply to collective decisions made, 
for example, by families, teams within firms, boards in international organizations, or coalition governments. 
We conduct laboratory and online experiments to tease out the heuristics subjects use in their responsibility 
attribution for collective decision makers. The lab experiments comprise a collective dictator game in which 
decision makers have weighted votes and recipients can punish individual decision makers. Our results show that 
recipients punish unfair allocations and mainly target the decision maker with proposal power and with the largest 
vote share. We find weak evidence that decision makers with veto power are targeted or that recipients punish 
proportional to vote share. The online experiment demonstrates that subjects indeed believe that the decision 
maker with proposal power has the most influence on the collective decision outcome. We discuss the implications 
of our findings for theories of vote choice.
